# SQL Bootcamp Project  

This repository contains SQL projects developed during a **Data Technician Bootcamp**, focused on analyzing **retail and sales data**. The work highlights the use of SQL to query, transform, and extract insights from relational databases.

## üéØ Project Highlights  

- **Data Retrieval & Filtering**  
  - Used `SELECT` statements to extract relevant columns from retail and sales tables.  
  - Applied `WHERE` clauses to filter data by product, customer, region, or time period.  

- **Sorting & Grouping**  
  - Leveraged `ORDER BY` to sort results for clearer reporting.  
  - Used `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) to summarize sales and customer behavior.  

- **Table Joins**  
  - Performed `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and other joins to combine data across multiple tables (e.g., Customers, Orders, Products).  
  - Built queries that provided a unified view of sales performance across regions and product categories.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated  

- Writing SQL queries to retrieve and filter data.  
- Sorting and summarizing information with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`.  
- Using joins to combine multiple tables for deeper analysis.  
- Extracting meaningful insights from retail and sales datasets.

## üöÄ How to Explore  

1. Review the `.sql` files in this repository to see the queries used.  
2. Each script demonstrates specific SQL concepts applied to retail and sales data.  
3. Queries can be run in **MySQL**, **SQL Server**, or other relational database systems (with minor syntax adjustments).

## üìå Notes  

- The datasets used are sample **retail and sales data** provided for learning purposes.  
- This project was completed as part of a **Data Technician Bootcamp**, showcasing SQL fundamentals applied in practical analysis.
